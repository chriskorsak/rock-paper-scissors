## Description

This application is based on the classic game, Rock Paper Scissors. Paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, and rock beats scissors. After a game is started, the user selects one of three options by clicking on an image, and the computer choice is randomly selected.

The winner of each round receives a point. If both answers are the same, the round is a tie. The first one to 5 points wins the game. A new game can be started after the current game has a winner.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

None. This is a web-based application hosted on Github pages. Check out the game [here!](https://chriskorsak.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)
